Biology 2 Class Visualizations
Welcome to the GitHub repository for visualizations related to the Biology 2 class at Raritan Valley Community College. This repository contains various charts and graphs demonstrating key concepts and data analyses covered in the course.

Course Details
Instructor: Priya Mangano
Institution: Raritan Valley Community College
Repository Contents
This repository includes visualizations for several environmental and biological measurements such as temperature, pH, turbidity, total solids, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total phosphates, nitrates, and fecal coliform. These visualizations are used to enhance understanding of the course material and to assist in the analysis of laboratory data.

Visualizations
Each folder within this repository corresponds to a specific set of data collected during the course experiments. The charts provide insights into:

Temperature variations between different probes and locations.
Water quality indicators such as turbidity and total solids.
Levels of dissolved oxygen and its percentage saturation in water samples.
Concentrations of nutrients and contaminants like phosphates and nitrates.
Measurement of fecal coliform as an indicator of water quality.
Usage
Students and faculty of the Biology 2 class can use these visualizations for educational and research purposes. They serve as a resource for understanding complex data and as a reference for preparing lab reports or presentations.

Acknowledgements
Special thanks to Professor Priya Mangano for her guidance and expertise, which greatly enhanced the learning experience and the development of these visualizations.
